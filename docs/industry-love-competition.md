# Industry Love Competition
## Gamified Monthly Competition for Hospitality Workers

---

## Overview

**Industry Love** is a unique gamification feature that creates friendly monthly competitions between neighboring bars and restaurants. Hospitality workers representing their workplace compete to show the most "love" to HOST venues, earning tangible rewards for their entire team.

**Key Differentiator**: This feature transforms industry staff from casual customers into brand ambassadors, creating viral growth and community engagement that no traditional POS system offers.

---

## Problem Statement

### Industry Pain Points
1. **Fragmented Community**: Hospitality workers rarely have platforms connecting them across venues
2. **Limited Staff Perks**: Industry workers often lack recognition or rewards for supporting peers
3. **Competitive Isolation**: Venues operate in silos without healthy competition
4. **Customer Acquisition Costs**: Traditional marketing is expensive and impersonal

### Our Solution
Create a visit-based (not spend-based) monthly competition where industry staff:
- Represent their workplace on the Guest app
- Earn points for their team with each venue visit
- Compete for team-wide rewards
- Build authentic community connections

**Result**: Viral growth, consistent traffic, and genuine brand advocacy.

## Core Mechanics

### Competition Structure

```
Month: October 2025
HOST Venue: "The Bourbon Room"
Geographic Radius: 5 miles

Competing Teams:
1. The Oak Barrel (23 visits) 🥇
2. Bourbon & Rye (19 visits) 🥈
3. Craft & Draft (15 visits) 🥉
4. Pour Decisions (12 visits)
5. Last Call (8 visits)

Winner Reward: 20% off all tabs in November
Runner-up Reward: Free appetizer per visit
Third Place: Priority reservations
```

### Scoring System

**Points Allocation:**
- ✅ **1 point per check-in** (regardless of spend amount)
- ✅ Visit verified by QR code scan or geofence check-in
- ✅ One visit per day per staff member counts
- ✅ All verified staff from a venue contribute to team total

**Why Visit-Based (Not Spend-Based)?**
- **Fairness**: Equal opportunity regardless of income level
- **Inclusivity**: Bartenders, servers, cooks all contribute equally
- **Authenticity**: Measures genuine support, not just big spenders
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and track

### Eligibility Requirements

**For Participants (Industry Staff):**
- Must be verified hospitality industry employee
- Must attach workplace to Guest profile
- Workplace must be bar/restaurant/hotel (not HOST client venue)

**For Venues to Compete:**
- Must have 3+ verified staff members registered
- Must be within geographic radius (default 5 miles)
- Must be active in current competition month
