## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Decisions
- **ADR-001**: Svelte 5 with runes for fine-grained reactivity
- **ADR-002**: Turso (LibSQL) for edge-ready database with local-first architecture
- **ADR-003**: Material Design 3 via m3-svelte for native Svelte components

### Quality Engineering
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- 1,027 total tests across 7 packages
- 99.93% statement coverage in business logic layer
- 100% function coverage in database layer
- Strict TypeScript mode with zero errors
- Automated code quality checks in CI/CD

### Performance Optimizations
- Turborepo caching for 80%+ build speedup
- Parallel test execution across packages
- Tree-shaking with Vite for minimal bundle size
- Edge database replication for <50ms query times
