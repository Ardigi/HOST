# ADR-001: Svelte 5 as Frontend Framework

## Status

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-09-29

**Deciders**: Tech Lead, Frontend Team

**Related ADRs**: None

## Context

### Background

We're building a modern POS system for bars and restaurants that requires:
- Fast, responsive UI for high-volume transactions
- Touch-optimized interface for tablets and mobile devices
- Real-time updates across multiple devices
- Offline-first capability
- Small bundle size for quick loading

### Problem Statement

We need to choose a frontend framework that can deliver exceptional performance, developer experience, and maintainability while keeping our bundle size small and our application fast.

### Driving Forces

- **Performance**: Sub-400ms response time requirement (Doherty Threshold)
- **Bundle Size**: Need minimal JS payload for quick loading on all devices
- **Developer Experience**: Modern DX with TypeScript, great tooling
- **Reactivity**: Built-in reactive system without extra libraries
- **Team Skills**: Team familiar with component-based frameworks

### Constraints

- Must support TypeScript
- Must work with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Must integrate well with our backend (tRPC, SvelteKit)
- Must have good accessibility support

---

## Decision

We will **use Svelte 5 as our primary frontend framework** along with SvelteKit 2 for the meta-framework.

### Reasoning

1. **Performance**: Svelte compiles to vanilla JavaScript, resulting in smaller bundles and faster runtime performance compared to virtual DOM frameworks
2. **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Svelte 5's new runes system (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) provides fine-grained reactivity without the complexity of hooks
3. **No Runtime Overhead**: Unlike React/Vue, Svelte shifts work to compile time, resulting in minimal runtime code
4. **Developer Experience**: Svelte's syntax is clean and intuitive, with great TypeScript support
5. **Ecosystem**: SvelteKit provides excellent SSR, routing, and API integration
6. **Bundle Size**: Svelte applications are typically 30-40% smaller than equivalent React apps

### Key Factors

- **Compile-time optimizations** eliminate runtime framework overhead
- **Runes API** in Svelte 5 provides a clear, predictable reactivity model
- **SvelteKit** offers first-class SSR, routing, and form handling
- **Growing ecosystem** with good library support
- **Better performance metrics** in Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Smaller Bundle Sizes**: 30-40% smaller than React equivalents
- **Faster Runtime Performance**: No virtual DOM diffing overhead
- **Cleaner Component Code**: Less boilerplate than React/Vue
- **Better UX**: Faster load times and smoother interactions
- **TypeScript Integration**: Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- **SvelteKit Integration**: Seamless full-stack development
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Built-in support for progressive enhancement

### Negative

- **Smaller Community**: Smaller than React/Vue ecosystems
- **Fewer Libraries**: Some niche libraries may not exist yet
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Svelte-specific concepts (runes, stores)
- **Hiring**: Fewer developers with Svelte experience in job market
- **Third-Party Components**: Fewer pre-built component libraries

### Neutral

- **Different Paradigm**: Requires shifting from virtual DOM thinking to compilation
- **Svelte 5 Runes**: New API requires adopting new patterns (but backward compatible)

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Limited library ecosystem | Medium | Medium | Build custom solutions, contribute to ecosystem |
| Team ramp-up time | Low | Low | Comprehensive training, excellent documentation |
| Hiring challenges | Medium | Medium | Train existing team, prioritize JS fundamentals in hiring |
| Breaking changes | Low | Medium | Follow upgrade guides, use TypeScript for safety |

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: React 18

**Description**: Use React 18 with TypeScript and Next.js

**Pros**:
- Largest ecosystem and community
- Most third-party libraries
- Easy to hire React developers
- Battle-tested in production
- Server Components in React 18

**Cons**:
- Larger bundle sizes (typically 40-50% larger)
- Virtual DOM overhead affects performance
- More boilerplate code (hooks, useEffect complexity)
- React Server Components still maturing
- Hooks can be confusing for complex state logic

**Why Rejected**: Bundle size and performance overhead don't meet our strict performance requirements. The virtual DOM adds unnecessary complexity for our use case.

### Alternative 2: Vue 3

**Description**: Use Vue 3 with Composition API and Nuxt 3

**Pros**:
- Good performance (better than React)
- Intuitive API
- Great documentation
- Strong ecosystem
- Nuxt 3 is excellent

**Cons**:
- Still larger bundle sizes than Svelte
- Options API vs Composition API fragmentation
- Less compile-time optimization than Svelte
- Reactivity system can be confusing (ref vs reactive)

**Why Rejected**: While Vue 3 is excellent, Svelte provides better performance and smaller bundles. Svelte 5 runes are clearer than Vue's ref/reactive system.

### Alternative 3: Solid.js

**Description**: Use Solid.js with SolidStart

**Pros**:
- Excellent performance (fine-grained reactivity)
- Similar API to React
- Very small bundle sizes
- No virtual DOM

**Cons**:
- Very small community and ecosystem
- Limited third-party libraries
- Immature tooling
- Hiring would be extremely difficult
- SolidStart is still in beta

**Why Rejected**: While Solid has great performance, the ecosystem is too immature for a production application. Svelte provides similar performance with a much more mature ecosystem.

## Implementation Notes

### Required Changes

- Setup Svelte 5 and SvelteKit 2 in monorepo
- Configure TypeScript with Svelte
- Setup Vite for build tooling
- Install essential Svelte libraries (testing, UI)
- Create component library structure

### Migration Plan

- Start all new features in Svelte 5
- Use runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) as primary reactivity API
- Gradually migrate shared components to Svelte (if needed)

### Timeline

- Week 1: Setup and configuration
- Week 2: Create base components and patterns
- Weeks 3-12: Build features using Svelte/SvelteKit

## Success Criteria

- Lighthouse performance score > 90
- First Contentful Paint < 1.0s
- Time to Interactive < 2.0s
- Bundle size < 200KB for main app
- Touch response time < 100ms
- Developer satisfaction > 8/10
